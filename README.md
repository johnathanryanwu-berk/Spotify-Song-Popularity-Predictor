# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a song will be **popular**
(top quantile of Spotify popularity) using audio features and metadata.
The project compares multiple modeling strategies and includes an interactive,
Spotify-styled dashboard for real-time inference.

## Project Highlights
- Full ML lifecycle: data preparation → modeling → evaluation → deployment
- Multiple model families:
  - LASSO Logistic Regression
  - CART & Random Forest
  - XGBoost (with LASSO feature selection and PCA)
- Feature selection using L1 regularization (LASSO)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Production-style scikit-learn pipelines
- Interactive Dash dashboard with model selection and real-time predictions

## Problem Definition
**Task:** Binary classification  
**Goal:** Predict whether a song is *popular*.

A song is labeled **popular = 1** if its Spotify popularity score falls within the
**top 10%** of the dataset; otherwise **popular = 0**.

**Input Features**
- Audio features: danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, valence, etc.
- Metadata: genre, key, mode, explicit flag, time signature
- Duration (converted to milliseconds)

## Modeling Strategy

Two parallel modeling pipelines are implemented.

### LASSO-Based Pipeline

One-Hot Encoding + Standardization
→ L1 Logistic Regression (feature selection)
→ CART / Random Forest / XGBoost

- LASSO performs automatic feature selection by shrinking coefficients to zero
- Selected features are passed to tree-based and boosting models
- Improves interpretability and reduces overfitting

---

### PCA-Based Pipeline

Ordinal Encoding + Standardization
→ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
→ CART / Random Forest / XGBoost

- PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving variance
- Enables efficient modeling in lower-dimensional space
- Useful for comparison against sparse, feature-selected models

---

## Interactive Dashboard

The project includes a Spotify-styled **Dash dashboard** that allows users to:
- Adjust audio features and metadata
- Select among trained models:
  - LASSO
  - CART + LASSO
  - Random Forest + LASSO
  - XGBoost + LASSO
  - CART + PCA
  - Random Forest + PCA
  - XGBoost + PCA
- View predicted probability of popularity in real time

All models are loaded as **joblib pipelines**, so preprocessing and inference are
handled automatically.

## Run Locally
### 1. Start the API (Terminal 1)
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn api:app --port 8000
```
### 2. Start the Dashboard (Terminal 2)
```bash
.venv/bin/python app_advanced.py
```
---

## Deployment (Dash + FastAPI on one URL)

This repo deploys as a single web app:

- Dash UI served at `/`
- FastAPI served at `/api` (docs at `/api/docs`)

### Local
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Example Results

- **LASSO Logistic Regression**: ROC-AUC ≈ **0.68**
- **CART + LASSO**: ROC-AUC ≈ **0.71**
- **Random Forest + LASSO**: ROC-AUC ≈ **0.72**
- **XGBoost + LASSO**: ROC-AUC ≈ **0.74**
- **XGBoost + PCA**: ROC-AUC ≈ **0.72**

(Exact results may vary by random seed and train/test split.)
